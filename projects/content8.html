                <p>In this project we were asked to develop a campaign to spread awareness to teens about fast

                <p>This assignments goal is to make teens aware how bad Fast Fashion is and that there are better
                    alternatives. This means that the target audience are teens. especially teens in The Netherlands.
                    Using this information we later have done interviews with dutch teens which really helped us get
                    good data to use.</p>

                    everyone got assigned to a different question. I got assigned to the 1.0 questions and 3.3

                <p>Before we started working on this assignment we wanted to divide the tasks using Trello. We all came
                    together to look at our questions and divide these questions in assignments. We looked at each
                    questions and though about how long this will take and what CMD methods we want to use. In
                    consultation Matheusz added everyone do an assignments with an deadline, you can see these in the
                    Trello which is really useful.</p>

                    <li>Of all the wastewater in the world, 20% is from textile dyeing and is highly toxic—
                        many countries where clothes are made have reduced or zero regulations for
                        wastewater disposal.</li>
                    <li>Microplastic fibers used in clothing make their way to the ocean, amounting to
                        about 500,000 tons—close to 50 billion plastic bottles.</li>
                    <li>Fashion manufacturing emits more than 10% of global carbon emissions.</li>
