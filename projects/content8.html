                <p>We decided to use this method because teachers gave us a lot of information about Double

                    Define whilst the second diamond represents Develop and Deliver.

                    questions and thought about how long this will take and what CMD methods we want to use. In

                <ul>
                    <li>The fashion industry uses 93 billion cubic meters of water per year.</li>
                    <li>It takes 3,781 liters of water to make one pair of jeans.</li>
                    <li>Of all the wastewater in the world, 20% is from textile dyeing and is highly toxic—
                        many countries where clothes are made have reduced or zero regulations for
                        wastewater disposal.</li>
                    <li>Microplastic fibers used in clothing make their way to the ocean, amounting to
                        about 500,000 tons—close to 50 billion plastic bottles.</li>
                    <li>Fashion manufacturing emits more than 10% of global carbon emissions.</li>
                    <li>We discard 92 million tons of clothes-related waste each year.</li>

                <cite>Figure 2 - Devan Janssen</cite>
                <p>During my research I found some helpful tips to find high quality garments. You can find those below.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-8">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Look for natural fibers: </b>High-quality garments are often made from natural fibers,
                        like cotton, silk linen, wool, or cashmere. These materials are not only durable, but
                        they also tend to feel more comfortable against the skin and have a better drape.</li>
                    <li><b>Check the stitching: </b>The stitching should be tight, even, and straight. Loose or
                        uneven stitching is a sign of poor quality and can cause the garment to fall apart
                        quickly.</li>
                    <li><b>Look at the seams: </b>Check for double-stitched seams, which add strength and
                        durability to the garment. Also, check for finished seams, which prevent fraying and
                        help the garment retain its shape over time</li>
                    <li><b>Check the lining: </b>High-quality garments often have a lining, which adds structure
                        and durability. The lining should be smooth and wrinkle-free.</li>
                    <li><b>Check the buttons: </b>High-quality garments typically have buttons made from
                        natural materials like mother-of-pearl or horn. These buttons are more durable and
                        look nicer than plastic buttons.</li>
                    <li><b>Look at the details: </b>High-quality garments often display small features that show
                        attention to detail, such as hidden buttons, hand-stitched hems, or reinforced
                        pockets.</li>
                    <li><b>Check the fit: </b>A high-quality garment should fit well and flatter your body. Look for
                        garments that are tailored to your body shape and have a comfortable fit.</li>
                    <li><b>Consider the brand: </b>Look for brands that are known for their quality and attention
                        to detail. These brands might be more expensive, but they're worth the investment if
                        you want a garment that will last you for years.</li>
                    <li><b>Check the care label: </b>The care label will tell you how to care for the garment to
                        ensure longevity. Garments that require delicate care are often of higher quality and
                        will last longer.</li>
                    <li><b>Look for a warranty: </b>Some high-end brands offer warranties on their garments,
                        which can give you peace of mind knowing that you are investing in a quality
                        product backed by the manufacturer.</li>

                <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
                <p>Personally, I buy a lot of clothes from all kinds of different brands. I encountered a lot of
                    clothes that are of bad quality and high quality. For example, I have a few white garments
                    from Zara. They are the same but still fit differently and are made in different countries,
                    on the other hand I have a few garments from Represent and these garments are of the
                    highest quality that I know of. They are expensive costing 120 euros but lasted me for a few
                    years already.</p>

                <p>The stakeholder was really happy with our presentation. She loved the idea and told us that this idea
                    was really unique. She also liked that we had done a lot of research. As feedback she told us that
                    we have done enough research and that we should make a few concept to show her at a later date. Next
                    up we want to make these concepts and think about our storytelling. After we are done with that we
                    want to plan another presentation with the stakeholder to show our concepts.</p>

                <p>In the final stage of the define phase we made our design. This design is based on a game with a
                    timeline of events. In the intro screen you get a few messages about the project and what the goal
                    of the game is, after that the game will start. The goal is to have enough money to buy a dress for
                    prom. In the game you have different events that happen every x amount of days. During each event
                    you have to wear clothes which can also break depending on the quality of the clothes.</p>

                <p>Before we started developing the game we looked at different ways to develop the game. I looked at
                    different game engines but that was over the top so we wanted to stick to HTML, CSS & JS. But there
                    is a twist. All of us were really eager to learn more about React so we wanted to also build our
                    game in React which for sure was a big challenge. We also
                    made a GitLab repository. Here every member has their own branch that they can safely push to.
                    Before merging changes we used WhatsApp to communicate so that we don't get any merging conflicts.

                <p>The first component I made was a receipt. This receipt is show on the bottom left of the page where
                    users can quickly see their wardrobe, because the wardrobe changes often opening the wardrobe every
                    time can get annoying.

                <p>What I did first was look at some receipts online and downloaded a free to use receipt font. Then
                    using HTML and CSS I made a receipt with all the items in the wardrobe. Initially we liked this idea
                    alot because
                    it was simple and worked.</p>

                <p>After some feedback from the target audience I chose to add 2 different wardrobes that I can further
                    test.</p>
                <p>Concept 1 can be found here. When the user clicks on the item in the receipt a small window will

                <h2>A/B Testing <span>LO4</span></h2>
                <h5>Questions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is it clear you can open the receipt?</li>
                    <li>Is it clear you can click on items?</li>
                    <li>Is it clear you can click on the receipt and open the wardrobe?</li>
                    <li>Do you find the receipt/wardrobe useful?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I asked five people from the target audience to test the first concept. I asked them if it was clear
                    that the receipt was openable, and that you can click on items to get more information. Most of them
                    opened the receipt by accident, and did not know you could click on the items in the receipt. I
                    would had to make them aware. After I told them how they could see more information, some of them
                    found it usefull whiles two people found it weird and out of place.</p>

                <p>I also asked five other people to test the second concept. Here we had the same outcome as the first
                    concept. The users did not know that you can click on the receipt. But when i explained that you can
                    all of them loved the idea of a wardrobe. Just needed a better style.</p>

                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>To conclude my testing i have chosen to stick with the wardrobe and make it look more appealing.</p>

                <h2>Final Iteration <span>LO1 & LO3</span></h2>
                <p>Finally I put all the feedback and testing together and made this design you can see in <cite>Figure
                        9</cite>. When hovering over an item more information about the item will be shown. You can also
                    wear items which I will explain later. Plamena added a header on top of the wardrobe.</p>

                <p>
                    I first designed the timeline in <cite>Figure 10</cite>. It is based on a timeline where the game
                    cycles trough main
                    events and secondary events. We all liked this idea because after events have ended screens will be
                    shown with outcomes and days passed. However the design did not fit with our overall game design.

                <p>
                    Because <cite>Figure 10</cite> was not good enough I tried to do a different approach. Here I
                    found out it
                    might be smart to add dynamic events that turn green when an event is completed. I quickly asked the
                    target audience and they all liked this. Meaning this is the timeline we will use. You can see this
                    iteration in <cite>Figure 11</cite>
                </p>

                <h2>Final Iteration <span>LO1 & LO3</span></h2>
                <p>I made a timeline (<cite>Figure 12</cite>) where the user can easily see how many events are
                    completed and how many events are
                    left. I did this by using a react.map function which checks for how many events are in the json
                    file. For each event it generates a circle that you can see below. In between each event a line will
                    be generated to show progress between the events. If the event index is active it will also change
                    the color to green and show a check to better visualize.</p>

                    card.
                    When hovering over the card more information about the event will be shown. All events have a
                    'wear
                    from closet' and 'buy from store' button. When pressed on the button the gamePhase will be
                    updated
                    which I will explain later.</p>

                    items based on the eventIndex. This means that for specific events we can show specific items.</p>

                <p>When the gamePhase is set to 4 a message will be shown with 'x' amount of days has been passed. This
                    demonstrated that between each days a different amount of days have been passed to better simulate a
                    schoolyear. Also after 'x' amount of days has passed the user will get 'x' amount of euros from
                    their Caretakers. When the user clicks on the continue button the gamePhase will be set to 1 again
                    and the cycles starts over with the next eventIndex (event 2). As shown in <cite>Figure 18</cite>.

                <p>To upload our game to Hera I used the 'npm run build' command in the terminal. This command makes a
                    'dist' folder. The 'dist' folder is a simplified version of our game meaning everything still works
                    but we only have a single html, js and css file. I then uploaded the 'dist' folder to Hera and the
                    game was ready to be tested.</p>

                <p>When our project was finally done we held a presentation for our stakeholder, teachers & students. In
                    this presentation we talked about our journey during this project. We also showed what our game is
                    about, the game phases and how our game is played in general.

                    have to polish a few things for example the budget & item prices. Also some outcomes did not fit the
                    bought item.</p>
