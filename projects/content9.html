            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>This is a song guessing game I made to improve my skills in Laravel & Tailwind. I used the Spotify
                    API to get the songs. The game is a single page application where the user can guess the song by
                    hearing a part of the song.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Introduction -->

        <!-- Initial Idea -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12" id="initial-idea">
                <h2>Initial Idea<span></span></h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>During the development of my portfolio I thought that my portfolio's project page looks boring, and I
                    wanted to spice it up more. So, I concepted an idea to make the page more appealing. I wanted to do
                    this by making a game where the projects are shown in a carrousel that moves. When the user clicks
                    on a project. A fisherman will cast his rod and catch the project. When the project is caught the
                    user will be redirected to that project page.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to final idea</h3>
                <p>During the Career Day at Fontys I approached a company called INDICIA. This company specializes in
                    making websites using Laravel. When I approached them, I told them more about me and what I want to
                    do in life. I told them that I want to be a full-stack developer. They were also interested. Because
                    I want to work in Laravel I first must learn more about Laravel. That is why I want to make
                    something in Laravel.</p>

                <h3>Final Idea</h3>
                <p>For the final idea I want to make a song guessing game. Something like 'Hitster'. Using the Spotify
                    API it is possible to play snippets of songs. The user then can guess the release year, song name &
                    artists name. Based on what the user got right the user will get points. At the end there will be a
                    leaderboard with the top ten users.</p>
                <p>If possible, I also want to add web sockets so that multiple users can play the game at one time
                    using their smartphones.</p>

                <p>I started with the authentication. Using the Spotify Developer Dashboard I added a new project to the
                    Spotify
                    Dashboard. In this project I added the Redirect URI and the Client ID. After doing this using the
                    code that spotify gave me I can add a button to my website where the user gets redirected to the
                    Spotify login page. When the user logs in, the user will be redirected back to my website and the
                    user will be logged in. You can see this in <cite>Figure 2</cite>.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>To make the game more repeatable I added eight different genres. This was by far the most difficult
                    to make because the Spotify API is outdated when it comes to getting songs. I first tried to ask for
                    a 30 second preview of all the songs (preview_uri) this did not work so I had to think about a
                    replacement. I found that it was possible to search by genre and then get the first 100 songs of
                    that genre. This kind of worked.

            <div class="col-6">
                <p>The song guessing part is the most important part of the game. This is where the user can guess the
                    song by hearing a part of the song. The user has three options to pick from one being corrent and 2
                    being incorrent.</p>

                <p>The game is based around 10 different rounds. The user can score points based on how quick the
                    corrent
                    answer is chosen. There is a timer of 30 seconds that counts down to zero. The maximum points per
                    round that can be received is sixty. Every second that passed the points goes down by two. After a
                    choice is selected the user will be redirected to the next song and the points are added to the
                    total points. When the user finished the game and completes the game the user will see how many
                    total
                    points have been earned. You can see this in <cite>Figure 3</cite>.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>To ensure the game was user-friendly and enjoyable, I conducted usability testing with five
                    participants. The testing focused on three main aspects:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Game mechanics and controls</li>
                    <li>User interface clarity</li>
                    <li>Overall user experience</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <p>The usability testing revealed several insights:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users found the timer and scoring system intuitive</li>
                            <li>The genre selection provided bad variety</li>
                            <li>Some users wanted more visual feedback when selecting answers</li>
                            <li>Mobile responsiveness needed minor adjustments</li>
                        </ul>

                </div>

                <h3>Improvements Made</h3>
                <p>Based on the feedback, I implemented several improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added visual feedback animations for correct/incorrect answers</li>
                    <li>Better genre selection and song variety</li>

                <h2>Visual Notification Feedback<span></span></h2>

                <p>To make the game more fun and clearer I added a visual notification feedback. When the user clicks on
                    a
                    correct answer the user will see a green notification. When the user clicks on an incorrect
                    answer the user will see a red notification. You can see this in <cite>Figure 4</cite>.</p>

                <h3>Better Genre & Song Variety<span></span></h3>

                <p>To improve I looked at different ways of generating the songs for the genres. During the tests I
                    found that some songs are seen multiple times, and the variety of songs was really bad.</p>

                <p>I found that I can add artists to the genres meaning when a genre is picked I will make a call to the
                    Spotify API and only ask recognizeable songs from artists that I personally have selected. By doing
                    it in this way songs wont be shown multiple times. In <cite>Figure 5</cite> you can see how this
                    works.</p>

                        <p>Users indicated they wanted more visual feedback when selecting answers. I implemented this
                            by:</p>

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing a new artist-based song selection system</li>
                            <li>Ensuring songs don't repeat within the same game session</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The improved system, as seen in <cite>Figure 5</cite>, now provides a more diverse song
                            selection.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Validation Results</h3>
                <p>After implementing these improvements, I validated the changes with the original users their feedback
                    was.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> Users now receive clear, feedback on their answers
                        through colored notifications</li>
                    <li><strong>Song Variety:</strong> The new genre-based system with curated artists has no more
                        song repetition and improved variety</li>
                    <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> The combination of visual feedback and better song selection
                        has created a more engaging and enjoyable game experience</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These improvements directly addressed the key issues identified in user testing, resulting in a more
                    polished and user-friendly game.</p>

                <p>However there was one last big problem. Right now when the artists are selected the API call asks for
                    all kinds of songs from specific artists. This means that some songs are not part of the genre. This
                    is a problem because the user will not be able to guess the song.</p>
