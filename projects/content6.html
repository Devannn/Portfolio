                <p>During our introduction week to semester three. We were split into different groups. Each group was
                    tasked to make a product that might be developed in 2050. We could pick one of these eight subjects.
                    As a group we were in doubt about choosing Love, Healthcare and Entertainment. We first chose
                    healthcare because we thought this would be very important in the future.

                <p>On day one everyone started with a few insights on research. I was a big fan of nanotechnology and 3d
                    printing because I think that these two subjects will be huge in the future.</p>

                <b>Nanotechnology and Advanced Drug Delivery</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Targeted Drug Delivery:</b> Nanotechnology will enable drugs to be delivered precisely where
                        they
                        are needed, minimizing side effects and maximizing effectiveness, particularly in cancer
                        treatment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Nanobots in the Bloodstream:</b> Nanobots could be deployed to identify and repair cellular
                        damage, clear clots, or even fight infections directly inside the body
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Illness:</b> What if we can use nanotechnology to prevent illnesses from developing, for
                        example
                        with nanobots we can see if the water you drink is clean or dirty. Dirt water causes a lot of
                        diseases so we can easily combat those. Combining this with our Wearables idea we can make a
                        good anti-disease mechanism

                    <li>
                        <b>Custom Implants and Prosthetics:</b> 3D printing will allow for the creation of highly
                        customized implants and prosthetics, perfectly suited to an individual's anatomy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Organ Bioprinting:</b> Lab-grown organs using a patient's own cells will reduce the need for
                        organ
                        donors, potentially eliminating transplant waiting lists and the risk of organ rejection.

                    <li>What if we make a bracelet for people to wear that will analyse the human body and sent data to
                        the doctors.</li>
                    <li>What if we make an exo skeleton for disabled people so that they can move and do daily
                        activities.</li>
                    <li>What if people with lung problems could exercise like other people?</li>
                    <li> What if we add nanotechnology to the human body, so that this tech can detect causes for
                        diseases
                        before they develop.</li>
                    <li>What if 3d printers exist that can develop organs and bodyparts for humans/animals</li>
                    <li>What if we make a chip that can restore memory loss for people with Alzheimer's/Dementia.</li>

                        Exoskeleton for people that are disabled/unable to move. Using the brain and an implant we can
                        read
                        what the user wants to achieve and with the use of the exoskeleton this can be possible.

                    <li>
                        <b>Idea 2:</b>
                        Use nanotechnology to detect diseases before they develop. For example, test the water that is
                        in the body. Dirty water has a high risk of developing diseases and infections. The
                        nanotechnology will also notify the user and doctors when something is wrong with the userâ€™s
                        body

                        <b>Idea 3:</b>
                        A headset that can relive memories, these memories will be stored on SD cards that can be traded
                        with other people to experience memories they never got to experience.

                <p>So, we finally concluded to make a headset like device that people can put memories in using SD
                    cards, these memories could be anyone's memory, which means we can share memories with other people.
                    So you might think how does this device work? Well there is a neuro device in the brain at all times
                    to document feelings.

                <p>I came up with the idea to add sd-cards that you can put in the device. Using the headset itself you

                <p>We started to work on the logic behind our concept because of course there are a lot of privacy
                    issues etc. So, we came up with the neurolink. This device is planted in the brain and can always
                    record everything. The headset itself just extract everything from the neurolink. The user itself
                    can decide which parts he/she wants to extract. Each memory can only be extracted to one SD card. So
                    that there are no chances of duplication memories and selling them. You can however still share your
                    memories with friends/family but only one at the time. This device can also be used during school to
                    give instructions or teach.</p>
