                <h3>What is NodeJS?</h3>
                <p>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. Originally,
                    JavaScript was used primarily for client-side tasks within the browser, but with Node.js, it can be
                    used to build server-side applications as well. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine,
                    making it fast and efficient for handling tasks like web servers, APIs, and real-time applications.

                <p>Amir gave us a little assignment to install a custom package using npm. This package has a function
                    to
                    generate a random one liner joke. In the readme you can see how the function works.</p>
                <p>I added a readme to the GitLab page to show how the code works and how you can make your own jokes.

                </p>
                <p>I did this by using a sprite image. This one image has all the states for Michael Jackson in it. And
                    using CSS you can choose which lenght and height in pixels the sprite will pick. For example the
                    first image is Michael Jackson standing still. This image is 40px long and 80px high.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>On the 22nd of November I attended the career day located at Strijp-S. Here I could find many
                    different companies that all do different kind of things. I walked around and found three companies
                    that suited me. one company really caught my eye.</p>

                <h3>Cape</h3>
                <p>The first company I want to talk about is Cape. This company specializes in automating digital
                    campaigns for other companies. They do this with their own program. The program is designed so that
                    companies can quickly change components in their pre-made ads. For example language or location of
                    products. I found this a bit interesting but not enough to do my internship here.</p>

                <h3>Multistax</h3>
                <p>Because i chose Cyber Security for my specialization I also wanted to look at a Cyber Security
                    company. Here is where i found Multistax they do all kinds of things but mainly focus on red and
                    blue teaming. Meaning the red team specializes in simulating real-life threats to identify
                    vulnerabilities. The blue team analyses these threats and developing methodologies to later prevent
                    these threats.</p>

                <h3>INDICIA</h3>
                <p>The third company was my favorite company. This company specializes in full-stack development using
                    Laravel which is exactly what i want to learn. The only downside was that the company specified that
                    they want students which are already familiar with these different coding languages: HTML5 - CSS -
                    Laravel</p>

                <p>During my Passion Project I want to make something in Laravel so I will understand the basics of
                    Laravel and so that I can show Indicia that I understand Laravel.</p>

                    has good benefits and a good salary. I've also found that all companies look for someone that also
