                <p>I started brainstorming for our logo and made the first logo design. It is
                    based
                    on old film tapes using the tape roll and the tape itself with our studio's name on it. I showed
                    this idea to our group, but they told me that the logo looks like our studio is a movie
                    production
                    studio which isn't what we want.</p>

                <p>After we discussed as a group that we want to make a logo that represents
                    all of
                    us together. That is where I found a Ransom Letters logo which we all liked so we started
                    working on
                    a logo where each person writes Lost Media on paper and where we chose each letter for our logo.
                    This took a long time.</p>

                <p>We were really proud of our Lost Media Ransom Letter Logo. But still wanted to
                    hear what different teachers had to say about it. Josh told us that the idea of the logo was really
                    unique but did not really fit the Lost Media name. He told us that the logo was a MTVish logo from
                    the early 2000's. Luckily Matheusz made an extra logo that has a retro design. Josh really liked
                    this
                    logo and thought that would perfectly represent our brand (classic and future combined).

                    could be used everywhere. He also gave us a tip to use the stripes in other designs for example
                    headers in documents or make custom elements we can use in our branding.</p>
